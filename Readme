# Introduction
	This is a demo for Monumenta - a cooperative PvE MMO Complete-The-Monument
	RPG.

	This is the first "major" dungeon in the game, named "The Halls of Wind and
	Blood". Monumenta contains several dungeons like this (as of this writing,
	12, with more added over time) each with different monsters and challenges 
	to overcome in pursuit of glorious loot.

	We call this a "demo" - but it's a full featured map that we hope will be
	fun to play through. It's got some advertisements at the beginning and end
	for the "real" server (which we hope you'll join!) but there's nothing
	intentionally missing/crippled here. It's a fun game, and we hope you enjoy
	it.

	Monumenta is a game developed entirely for free by members of the
	Complete-The-Monument (CTM) community. It collects only enough money (via
	donations) to pay for hosting - the game is free to play forever, and has
	no pay-to-win elements.

	The team consists of more than 40 random people on the Internet who have
	come together over the years to build a great game we could all enjoy
	playing.

	Development and support for Monumenta is communicated almost entirely via
	Discord - sort of a hybrid chat room / forum. We have a modest, friendly
	community there, including ways to submit bugs and get help from
	moderators.

# Monumenta Resource Pack
	Monumenta has a resource pack that gives a unique texture/model to the 
	majority of the hundreds of custom pieces of gear to be found in the game. 
	Though it is developed by the player community, it is considered official and 
	fully endorsed by the developers. We hope you consider checking it out, as 
	it also	allows you to know items at a glance and gives a lot of character 
	to the loot	of the game.
	
	It does not influence anything found outside Monumenta or retexture vanilla
	Minecraft items/blocks/mobs.
	
	Installation:
		- Ensure you have Java installed (minimum version 1.8)
		- Install the latest version of Optifine for the version of Minecraft that 
			Monumenta is using (at time of writing it is 1.13.2).
		- Run the Optifine installation you just installed through the Minecraft
			Launcher.
		- Download the Monumenta Resource Pack, drop the .zip file into your 
			resourcepacks folder in your Minecraft directory, and enable it in-game.

# Technical Details:
	This is a stand-alone game. Unlike many other minecraft maps that you
	install by copying into your maps folder, this runs a stand-alone server
	which you will connect to using your minecraft client. The reason for this
	is that Monumenta has a significant number of features that can't be
	implemented using only in-game commands.

	The demo (like the actual Monumenta server and so many others) is built on
	open-source modding software called Paper (based on Spigot and Bukkit).
	This allows us to write "plugins" which implement cool stuff. One of the
	biggest things that makes Monumenta unique is player classes - in this demo
	you can choose to play as a Mage, Warrior, or Scout, each with unique
	abilities. The full Monumenta game has 7 classes, with 14 advanced classes 
	and just over 100 different special abilities they can use.

	When you run this demo, you're really running a minecraft server which you
	can then connect to and play. You can do this by running either the
	start_monumenta_demo.bat (Windows) or start_monumenta_demo.sh (Linux)
	script. This will start a server listening on the default minecraft port
	(25565). If you're playing solo, you can launch Minecraft version 1.13.2
	and connect to "localhost" to join the game. If you want to play with
	friends, you'll need to make sure Minecraft is allowed through your
	firewall and give them your IP address to connect to.


# A note on running random software from the Internet:
	Running untrusted software on your computer is probably a bad idea. It
	seems like Minecraft's modding community has somehow managed to thrive
	despite this - you can download modpacks containing software from hundreds
	of different people and it seems to mostly be ok.

	We know that the way we're distributing this demo is odd - but that's how
	free software goes. All we can do is swear that to the best of our
	knowledge, this demo contains nothing malicious. It will not collect any
	information from your computer or read or modify anything outside of its
	own folder.

	If you'd prefer not to run this on your computer, we encourage you to try
	out the game by connecting to the server's main address in Minecraft:
	server.playmonumenta.com

# Copyright information:
	Monumenta certainly does not own the right to distribute any source
	code/etc. from Mojang. If you look in this zip file, you'll find a large
	paperclip.jar file. When launched, this file goes to Mojang's servers and
	downloads the appropriate minecraft server.jar file and patches it to
	contain the custom code that open-source developers have added to make it
	possible to develop "plugins" for Minecraft. It does not contain the
	minecraft source code itself.

    You can find more information about Paper here: https://papermc.io/

	If you look in the 'plugins' folder, you'll find this demo is distributed
	with three plugins:
		JeffChestSort - Open source, right clicking any empty space in a chest
		twice will sort that chest.
            https://github.com/JEFF-Media-GbR/Spigot-ChestSort

		ScriptedQuests - Open source (and developed by Monumenta). Provides a
		way to interact with NPCs more easily for questing.
            https://github.com/TeamEpic/Scripted-Quests

		MonumentaMain - Closed source (currently, but this may change).
		Provides class abilities & all the other goodies that make Monumenta
		work.

	We are doing our best to comply in good faith with all the wonderful people
	who have contributed to make Minecraft an excellent gaming platform 10
	years after its original release.
